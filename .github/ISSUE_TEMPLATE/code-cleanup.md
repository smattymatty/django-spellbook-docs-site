## **Code Location**

*Specify the exact location of the code that needs cleanup:*
- **File(s)**: 
- **Module(s)/Classes**: 
- **Functions/Methods**: 
- **Line Range**: (if applicable)

## **Current Problems**

*Describe the specific issues with the current code:*

### **Code Quality Issues**
- [ ] Functions/methods exceed recommended length (>50 lines)
- [ ] Classes have too many responsibilities
- [ ] Deep nesting levels (>3-4 levels)
- [ ] Code duplication
- [ ] Hard-coded values

### **Maintainability Issues**
- [ ] Poor naming conventions
- [ ] Lack of documentation/comments
- [ ] Complex conditional logic
- [ ] Tight coupling between components
- [ ] Inconsistent error handling

### **Testing Issues**
- [ ] Difficult to unit test
- [ ] Low test coverage
- [ ] Brittle or slow tests
- [ ] Missing edge case coverage

### **Performance Issues**
- [ ] Inefficient algorithms
- [ ] Memory leaks
- [ ] Unnecessary computations
- [ ] Database query optimization needed

## **Current Code Structure**

*Briefly describe how the code is currently organized:*

```
Example:
Class UserManager:
  - handles authentication
  - manages file uploads  
  - sends emails
  - database operations
  - logging
```

## **Proposed Refactoring**

*Describe the target structure after cleanup:*

```
Example:
- UserAuthenticator: authentication logic
- FileUploadService: file handling
- EmailService: email operations
- UserRepository: database access
- Logger: activity logging
```

## **Refactoring Strategy**

*Outline the approach for implementing changes:*
- [ ] Extract utility functions
- [ ] Break down large classes/methods
- [ ] Implement design patterns
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests

## **Files to be Altered or Created**

*List specific files affected by this refactoring:*
- **New Files**: 
- **Modified Files**: 
- **Deleted Files**: 
- **Test Files**: 

## **Breaking Changes**

*Identify any potential breaking changes:*
- [ ] API signature changes
- [ ] Database schema modifications
- [ ] Configuration changes required
- [ ] Import statement updates needed

## **Success Metrics**

*Define measurable outcomes:*
- [ ] Reduced cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] Improved test coverage (target: %)
- [ ] Decreased code duplication
- [ ] Performance improvements (if applicable)
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

## **Implementation Plan**

*Suggested phases for implementing this cleanup:*
1. Phase 1: 
2. Phase 2: 
3. Phase 3: 
4. Phase 4: 

## **Risk Assessment**

*Evaluate potential risks:*
- **Risk Level**: High/Medium/Low
- **Primary Concerns**: 
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 

## **Additional Context**

*Add any other technical details, performance benchmarks, or implementation notes.*
