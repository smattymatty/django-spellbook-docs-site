This guide demonstrates how to render markdown files managed by `django-spellbook` into HTML by calling its parsing function directly from within a custom Django function-based view. This approach offers maximum flexibility for integrating `django-spellbook`'s rendering capabilities into your existing Django project workflows.

{~ label_seperator ~}
## The Goal: Dynamic Markdown Pages
{~~}

Often, you might have markdown files stored within your project that you want to serve as HTML pages. Instead of relying solely on `django-spellbook`'s automatic view generation (if available for your use case), you might need to:

* Add custom logic before or after rendering the markdown.
* Pass additional, dynamic context to the template that displays the markdown.
* Integrate markdown rendering into an existing, complex view.

The `render_spellbook_markdown_to_html` function allows you to do just this.

{~ label_seperator ~}
## Example Django View (`views.py`)
{~~}

Here's an example of a simple Django function-based view that reads a markdown file, processes it using `django-spellbook`, and then renders it using a standard Django template:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from django.shortcuts import render
from django_spellbook.parsers import render_spellbook_markdown_to_html

# Define the path to your markdown content folder
content_folder = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'content'

def index(request):
    # Construct the path to a specific markdown file
    markdown_file_path = content_folder / 'home.md'

    # Read the raw markdown content from the file
    with open(markdown_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        raw_markdown_content = f.read()

    # Render the raw markdown to HTML using django-spellbook's parser
    html_content = render_spellbook_markdown_to_html(raw_markdown_content)

    # Prepare context for your Django template
    context = {
        'content': html_content,
        'sidebar_header': 'Welcome to My Site!',
        # Add any other context variables your template might need
    }

    # Specify the Django template to use
    template_name = 'A_base/base.html' # Your base template

    return render(request, template_name, context)
```

{~ label_seperator ~}
## Breaking Down the View
{~~}

Let's look at the key parts of this example view:

{~ accordion title="1. Imports and Setup" ~}
* `from pathlib import Path`: `pathlib` is used for robustly handling file system paths in a platform-independent way.
* `from django.shortcuts import render`: The standard Django shortcut to render a template with a given context.
* `from django_spellbook.parsers import render_spellbook_markdown_to_html`: This is the core function from `django-spellbook` that will convert your markdown string (with SpellBlocks) into an HTML string.
* `content_folder = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'content'`: This line constructs an absolute path to a subdirectory named `content` located in the same directory as your `views.py` file. This is where your markdown files (like `home.md`) are assumed to be stored.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="2. The `index` Function" ~}
* `def index(request):`: This is a standard Django view function that takes an `HttpRequest` object.
* `markdown_file_path = content_folder / 'home.md'`: Constructs the full path to the `home.md` file.
* `with open(...) as f: raw_markdown_content = f.read()`: This securely opens and reads the entire content of your `home.md` file into the `raw_markdown_content` string. Using `encoding='utf-8'` is good practice.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="3. Parsing with `render_spellbook_markdown_to_html`" ~}
* `html_content = render_spellbook_markdown_to_html(raw_markdown_content)`: This is the magic step! You pass the raw markdown string (which can contain your SpellBlocks like `~ card ~`, `~ alert ~`, etc.) to this function. It processes the markdown, resolves SpellBlocks, and returns a string of HTML ready to be displayed.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="4. Building the Context" ~}
* `context = { ... }`: A standard Python dictionary that holds the data you want to make available in your Django template.
    * `'content': html_content`: The rendered HTML from `django-spellbook` is passed to the template under the key `content`.
    * `'sidebar_header': 'Welcome to My Site!'`: An example of another piece of dynamic data you might want to pass to your template.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="5. Rendering the Template" ~}
* `template_name = 'A_base/base.html'`: Specifies which Django template file should be used to display the content.
* `return render(request, template_name, context)`: This function takes the request, the template name, and the context dictionary, and returns an `HttpResponse` with the rendered HTML page.
{~~}

{~ label_seperator ~}
## Example Markdown Content (`content/home.md`)
{~~}

The `home.md` file referenced in the view could contain any markdown valid for `django-spellbook`, including your custom SpellBlocks. For instance, it might look something like the introduction page you showed:

Welcome To the Examples of Django Spellbook!

Django Spellbook is a powerful toolkit for creating and managing markdown-based content in your Django projects. It's designed to be simple, flexible, and easy to use, with a focus on maintainability and extensibility.

This examples serves as a collection of real-world examples showcasing the capabilities of Django Spellbook. It's a great resource for learning how to use Django Spellbook and exploring its features.

{~ card title="Basic Markdown" footer="Updated: Today" ~}
1. Install the package
2. Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`
3. Start writing magical markdown!
{~~}

## What Are SpellBlocks?

SpellBlocks are reusable content components that you can embed directly in your markdown files. They work like Django template tags but are designed specifically for enhancing your documentation.
... and so on ...

## Example Django Template (`A_base/base.html`)
{~~}

The Django template (`A_base/base.html` in this example) would then display the rendered HTML. It's crucial to use the `|safe` filter when outputting HTML content generated by `django-spellbook` to prevent Django from auto-escaping it.

A very basic `A_base/base.html` might look like this:

```html
{% verbatim %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Spellbook Site</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/spellbook-styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>{{ sidebar_header|default:"My Page" }}</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        </nav>
    <main>
        {{ content|safe }}
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 My Awesome Site</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
{% endverbatim %}
```

**Key part:** `{ content|safe }` ensures that the HTML generated by `render_spellbook_markdown_to_html` is rendered as HTML and not as escaped text.
