# Progress SpellBlock (`~ progress ~`): Level Up Your Content

The `~ progress ~` SpellBlock is a versatile tool for visualizing progress. Beyond simple percentages, it can be a powerful familiar in illustrating skill acquisition, academic achievements, career milestones, and personal development â€“ a true "leveling up" visual. The integrated popover, customizable with `content_bg_color` and `content_color`, allows for rich contextual information.

## Basic Usage

A quick refresher:

```django
{~ progress value="65" label="Overall Profile Completion" ~}
Your profile is looking good! Just a few more sections to fill out.
{~~}
```

Renders as:
{~ progress value="65" label="Overall Profile Completion" ~}
Your profile is looking good! Just a few more sections to fill out.
{~~}

## Parameters for Popover Styling

In addition to the previously listed parameters, we now highlight those for theming the popover content:

* **`content_bg_color`** (String, Optional): Sets the background color of the popover. Accepts theme color names (e.g., `primary`, `success-25`, `neutral-90`). If not set, it defaults to a standard popover style (e.g., white).
* **`content_color`** (String, Optional): Sets the text color within the popover. Accepts theme color names or standard CSS color values. If not set, it defaults to a standard text color suitable for the default popover background.

## Themed Examples: Education, Resume & Leveling Up

Let's see how `content_bg_color` and `content_color` can make the popover an extension of the progress bar's theme.

### Academic Achievements

**Degree Completion:**
Illustrating progress towards a Bachelor of Magical Arts. The popover provides details about the current year and focus.

```django

**Current Status: Year 3 of 4**
Focusing on Advanced Transfiguration and Ancient Runes. Thesis proposal on "Temporal Distortions in Ley Line Magic" submitted. Expected graduation: Spring 2026.
{~~}
```

Renders as:

**Mastering a Difficult Subject:**
Showing progress in "Advanced Potion Brewing," with popover details matching the "warning" theme of a challenging subject.

**Potion Brewing - Current Standing:**

{~~}

{~ alert type="info" title="A Note on Colors" ~}
The `color`, `bg_color`, `content_bg_color`, and `content_color` parameters typically expect theme color names (like `primary`, `info-50`, `black-75`). The actual color values are defined in your site's CSS (e.g., using CSS variables like `--primary-color`). Ensure your chosen color names have corresponding styles for both backgrounds (`sb-bg-*`) and text (`sb-text-*` or direct color application) for optimal results.
The popover's default styling will apply if `content_bg_color` and `content_color` are not specified.
