                                <li>
                                    <strong>Version Control</strong>: Keep your Markdown files under version control.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Run this command as part of your deployment process to ensure your HTML templates are always up-to-date.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Custom Base Template</strong>: Create a custom <span class="inline-code">grimoire_base.html</span> in your app's templates directory for consistent styling and layout.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    For issues with custom blocks, ensure they are properly registered in your app's <span class="inline-code">grimoire_blocks.py</span> file.

This command is particularly useful for maintaining and updating documentation or content that is written in Markdown but needs to be served as HTML in your Django application. The <span class="inline-code">generate_grimoire</span> command is typically run from the command line in your Django project directory: Before using the command, ensure you have the following settings in your Django <span class="inline-code">settings.py</span>: Also, within your CONTENT_APP's templates folder, include a grimoire_base.html to render all of your content to. There are some pre-defined context variables to be used in your grimoire_base.html: These context variables are given to the templates on command run, and then the templates are each fully rendered. If you one of these context variables changes, you will have to run the command again to fully update. Assuming you have the following structure: Running the command: Will generate: The Grimoire_Parser is a crucial component of Django-Spellbook, designed to parse and transform custom markdown-like syntax into HTML.
