{~ hero layout="text_only_centered" bg_color="black-50" text_color="white" min_height="400px" content_align_vertical="center" text_bg_color="info-25" class="hero-service-intro" ~}
### Released May 21, 2025

This update includes two new SpellBlocks: `~ hero ~` and `~ progress ~`. These are both very powerful and versatile components that can be used to create compelling and visually appealing content.

Ideally, you would never have to leave your markdown editor to create a hero section or progress bar. These blocks are designed to be easy to use and provide a solid foundation for building more complex content.

Including 6 different layouts, several parameters, and several different styling options.

## Progress SpellBlock

The `~ progress ~` SpellBlock offers a clear and adaptable method for visually representing various metrics such as project completion, skill proficiency, academic progress, or funding status against a defined maximum.

```django
{~ progress value="65" label="Profile Status" ~}
Profile is 65% complete. Ensure all sections are finalized for optimal visibility.
