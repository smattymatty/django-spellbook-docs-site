# New Features

## Customizable URL Prefixes

You can now customize URL prefixes for your markdown content, both for single and multiple source configurations:

```python
# Single source with custom URL prefix
SPELLBOOK_MD_PATH = BASE_DIR / "docs"
SPELLBOOK_MD_APP = "docs_app"
SPELLBOOK_MD_URL_PREFIX = "documentation"  # Content at /documentation/
```

```python
# Multiple sources with custom URL prefixes
SPELLBOOK_MD_PATH = [BASE_DIR / "docs", BASE_DIR / "blog"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_APP = ["docs_app", "blog_app"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_URL_PREFIX = ["docs", "articles"]  # At /docs/ and /articles/
```

If no URL prefix is specified:

- Single app configurations use an empty prefix (root URL)
- Multiple app configurations give the first app an empty prefix, and use app names for others


## Enhanced Error Handling

The command now provides better error messages and diagnostic information when things go wrong:

- Clear identification of the source of errors (settings, file discovery, processing)
- Helpful suggestions for resolving common issues
- Improved logging of error details
- New `--continue-on-error` flag to process as many files as possible even when some fail

# Architecture Improvements

## Modular Command Structure

The `spellbook_md` command has been refactored into a modular architecture:

```
django_spellbook/
├── management/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── command_utils.py          # Shared utilities
│   │   ├── spellbook_md.py           # Main command
│   │   └── spellbook_md_p/           # Command components
│   │       ├── processor.py          # Markdown processing
│   │       ├── discovery.py          # File/block discovery
│   │       └── exceptions.py         # Specialized exceptions
```

Benefits of this new architecture:

- Improved maintainability with focused modules
- Better testability with clear component boundaries
- Easier extensibility for future features
- Enhanced error handling and reporting

## Customizable Base Templates Per Source

You can now specify different base templates for each markdown source, allowing for tailored layouts across your content:

```python
# Single source with custom base template
SPELLBOOK_MD_PATH = BASE_DIR / "docs"
SPELLBOOK_MD_APP = "docs_app"
SPELLBOOK_MD_BASE_TEMPLATE = "docs/base.html"  # Custom base template
```

```python
# Multiple sources with different base templates
SPELLBOOK_MD_PATH = [BASE_DIR / "docs", BASE_DIR / "blog"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_APP = ["docs_app", "blog_app"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_BASE_TEMPLATE = ["docs/base.html", "blog/base.html"]  # Different templates
```

If a single base template is provided with multiple sources, it will be applied to all sources:

```python
# Shared base template across multiple sources
SPELLBOOK_MD_PATH = [BASE_DIR / "docs", BASE_DIR / "blog"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_APP = ["docs_app", "blog_app"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_BASE_TEMPLATE = "shared_base.html"  # Same template for all sources
```

If no base template is specified (or set to `None`), the default behavior remains unchanged:

```python
# Default template behavior
SPELLBOOK_MD_PATH = [BASE_DIR / "docs", BASE_DIR / "blog"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_APP = ["docs_app", "blog_app"]
SPELLBOOK_MD_BASE_TEMPLATE = None  # Default template for all sources
```

## Enhanced Template Validation

The template system now includes improved validation:

- Verification that base template configurations match source configurations
- Path validation to prevent template path traversal vulnerabilities
- Helpful error messages for template-related configuration issues

## Summary Report Generation

The command now produces a comprehensive summary after processing:

- Total files processed across all sources
- Success rate for each source-destination pair
- Detailed information about any failures
- Processing statistics

# Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed an issue where multi-source configurations could have URL routing conflicts
- Improved validation of settings to catch configuration errors earlier
- Enhanced source path normalization for Windows compatibility
- Added better progress indicators during processing
