## **Version 0.1.13**

*Released: May 11, 2025*

{~ alert type="success" ~}
This release includes a total re-write of the spellbook processor, now under `django_spellbook.markdown.engine.SpellbookMarkdownEngine`. Also, a helpful `django_spellbook.parsers.render_spellbook_markdown_to_html` function has been added to render markdown to HTML.

# New Features

## Spellbook Markdown Engine

The `django_spellbook.markdown.engine.SpellbookMarkdownEngine` class has been completely re-written to provide a more robust and flexible implementation.

## Don't worry,

The `python manage.py spellbook_md` does not use this new re-written engine (yet), so you can continue to use the old one for now.

This new engine is designed for use in your own custom views or functions via helper functions:

```python
from django_spellbook.parsers import render_spellbook_markdown_to_html

def my_view(request):
    markdown_text = "# Hello, World!"
    html = render_spellbook_markdown_to_html(markdown_text)
    return HttpResponse(html)
```

## We also fixed a lot of bugs

There is no new 'content' in this update, but it involves a lot of refactoring and bug fixes.
