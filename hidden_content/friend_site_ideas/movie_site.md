## Movie Site

This is a list of ideas for a movie site.


## Idea

{~ card title="Movie Website" footer="Brought to you by Michael J Earwicker." ~}
A website showcasing movies, actors, producers, and directors.
{~~}

## SpellBlock Design: Weaving the Cinematic Web

The site's visual appeal and user experience will heavily rely on custom-designed SpellBlocks. These blocks will be categorized into stylistic elements that enhance visual presentation and functional components that handle data display and interaction, particularly with IMDB data.

{~ accordion title="Target Audience & Purpose" open=true ~}
**For the Site Owner (Content Creator):**
This `django-spellbook` powered site will offer a flexible and powerful way to:

* Share personal reviews, insights, and curated lists of movies and talent.
* Build a personalized, searchable database of cinematic interests.
* Easily manage and update content through markdown and Spellbook's intuitive structure.

**For the Site Visitor (The Movie Lover):**
The audience consists of individuals passionate about movies who are looking to:

* Discover new films, actors, directors, and other creative talents.
* Explore detailed information and connections within the film industry.
* Read engaging commentary and curated content from a fellow enthusiast.
* Find inspiration for what to watch next.
{~~}

### I. Stylistic SpellBlocks (Visual Flair & Engagement)

These blocks are primarily for aesthetic presentation and drawing user attention, without complex data logic.

{~ card title="1. Hero Banner Block" footer="Commanding Attention" ~}
**Purpose:** To create a visually stunning entry point on key pages (homepage, individual movie/actor pages).
**Content:**

* High-resolution background image (movie still, actor portrait).
* Overlayed text: Movie title, actor's name, or a compelling tagline.
* Optional: A brief introductory snippet or bio (1-2 sentences).
* A clear call-to-action button or link (e.g., "Explore Movie Details," "View Full Bio").
{~~}

**Example Usage:**
```markdown
{~ hero_banner title="Inception (2010)" image_url="/path/to/inception_banner.jpg" tagline="Your mind is the scene of the crime." link_url="/movies/inception/" link_text="Explore Inception" ~}
```

{~ card title="2. Featured Content Block (Movie/Person)" footer="Spotlight on Favorites" ~}
**Purpose:** Allows the site owner to highlight a specific movie, actor, or director on the homepage, in a sidebar, or within a blog post.
**Content:**

* Thumbnail image (movie poster, headshot).
* Title (Movie Name / Person's Name).
* Short, engaging summary written by the site owner (e.g., "Why I love this film," "A standout performance").
* Link to the full detail page on the site.
* Optional: Link to an external resource like a trailer (for movies) or official website.
{~~}

**Example Usage:**
```markdown
{~ featured_content type="movie" title="Parasite (2019)" image_url="/path/to/parasite_poster.jpg" link_url="/movies/parasite/" trailer_url="[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xH0HfJHsaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xH0HfJHsaY)" ~}
A groundbreaking thriller that masterfully blends dark comedy with social commentary. A must-watch!
{~~}
```

### II. Functional SpellBlocks (Data-Driven Insights & IMDB Integration)

These are the workhorse blocks, designed to display detailed information, often by fetching and presenting data from IMDB or a similar database.

{~ quote author="Mike" source="Project Brainstorm" ~}
Basically any time I am talking about a person, it would be cool if it could automatically pull their works and the other people they worked with from IMDB and populate the page with that data.
{~~}

{~ alert type="info" title="IMDB Integration Note" ~}
The automatic pulling of data from IMDB would require using an IMDB API (if available and within terms of service for this kind of use) or a web scraping solution (which can be fragile and may have legal/ethical implications). This is a significant technical aspect to consider. For each card, we'll assume an `imdb_id` parameter could be used to fetch data.
