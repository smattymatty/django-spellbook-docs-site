## Core Enchantments for Educators

Here lie the primary spells and constructs at your disposal, designed to make your teaching journey more magical and efficient:

1.  **The Question Spell:**
    * **Essence:** Your fundamental tool for seamlessly embedding questions and their corresponding answers directly within your educational content.
    * **Magic:** Creates a dynamic, reusable database of knowledge, forming the bedrock for all interactive assessments and study aids. Effortlessly define questions as you write, complete with metadata like difficulty, topics, and answer keys.

2.  **Test Pages:**
    * **Essence:** Automatically generate comprehensive and customizable examination scrolls.
    * **Magic:** Conjure formal assessments from your "Question Spell" repository. Define parameters like question count, topics covered, time limits, and difficulty to create tailored tests for your students, evaluating their mastery of the mystical arts. This is a powerful enchantment for gauging true understanding.

3.  **Quiz Blocks:**
    * **Essence:** Embed interactive learning checkpoints directly within your lessons and chapters.
    * **Magic:** Weave engaging quizzes into your content with a simple `~ quiz ... ~` incantation. These blocks can draw from specific tags or topics, offering immediate feedback and reinforcing learning as students journey through your spellbook.

```markdown
{~ quiz title="Chapter 3: Potion Basics Review" tags=["potions", "chapter3"] count="5" ~}
```

4.  **Flashcard Blocks:**
    * **Essence:** Transform key terms, concepts, and Q&A pairs into interactive digital flashcards.
    * **Magic:** Empower your students with a classic, yet magically enhanced, study tool. The `~ flashcards ... ~` block allows for shuffling and focused review, aiding memorization and knowledge retention, making the driest of subjects more palatable.

```markdown
{~ flashcards tags=["herbology_terms_intermediate"] shuffle="true" ~}
```

5.  **Matching Game Blocks:**
    * **Essence:** Create engaging, game-like activities for reinforcing associations and vocabulary.
    * **Magic:** Add a touch of playful enchantment with `~ matching_game ... ~`. Students can match terms to definitions, symbols to meanings, or any paired concepts, making learning an interactive quest rather than a mere recitation.
